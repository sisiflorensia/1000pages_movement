# [1000 Pages Movement](https://sisiflorensia.github.io/1000pages_movement/)

## What
This is a challenge to keep ourselves committed to daily practice of coding. Each and everyday, upload one webpage to your github, regardless the complexity.

## Why
They said it takes 10K hours to master something. Let's do it in 1K ;)

## When
The idea is to do it daily, and move on to different page the next day. This way, we can keep our daily creativity juice going on and not stuck in one spot.

## Who
It's perfect for anyone who's new or just come back to coding.
And anyone of any level can do it. Challenge yourself a bit more each day, no matter how good you are.

## How
- Let go the idea of perfection. This is a space for you get creative.
- If you want to publish it, that's great! If you want to make it private, that's great too! Please remember, you are doing this for you.
